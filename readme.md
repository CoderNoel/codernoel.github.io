# Codernoel's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! This simple website displays my contact details and title as a Software Developer and a CS Student.

## Description
This repository contains the source code and assets for my personal website, which serves as a portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The website is still in development, and therefore I have yet to add the projects and skills section. This website is a direct inspiration from [`carrd.co`](https://www.carrd.co) and is designed with a clean and modern look, focusing on usability and highlighting the projects I have worked on.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to develop this website:

- HTML5
